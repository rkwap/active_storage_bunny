# Active Storage Bunny

[Bunny](https://bunny.net/storage/) is a fast, powerful, cheap and reliable CDN service and offers a storage service that can be used to store files which is a great alternative to Amazon S3, Azure, and Google Cloud Storage.

Active Storage Bunny is a gem that integrates BunnyCDN Storage services with Active Storage. This gem acts as an adapter to add BunnyCDN as a service to Active Storage.

This uses [BunnyStorage Client](https://github.com/rkwap/bunny_storage_client?tab=readme-ov-file#bunnystorage-client) gem to interact with BunnyCDN storage services.

bunny:
  service: Bunny
